# Advent of Code 2019

[Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) is an awesome advent calendar that invites you to solve problems every day in December. You solve each day 1 part at a time in order to unlock the next parts.

This repo contains my solutions to the 2019 challenges.

Also, my 2018 solutions are here: [2018 Advent of Code](https://github.com/mindplace/advent_of_code_2018)
